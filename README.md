# Multidimensional Confidence Region Calculation and Plotting

## Description
This repository contains Python code for calculating and plotting multidimensional confidence regions. These regions represent ranges of parameter values that are consistent with a given set of data, assuming a certain level of confidence. This tool is incredibly useful in a variety of statistical and scientific applications where you want to visualize and understand the uncertainty in estimated parameters.

## Requirements
The following Python packages are needed to run the scripts in this repository:

* Python 3.7+
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib

You can install these packages with pip using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

<!-- ## Structure of the Repository
The repository is structured as follows:

## Usage

### Calculate and Plot Confidence Region

You can use the `Multidimensional ellipse plot.ipynb` notebook to calculate and plot a confidence region. 
### Run Examples

You can run the examples using Run all button.

These scripts will generate plots of the confidence regions based on randomly generated data that can be replaced with real one. The resulting plots will be presented in notebook.
